I'm **Wei Han**. I’m interested in **geometry processing, numerical optimization, and discrete differential geometry**.

I worked at **Tencent** and **DJI** as a backend/Devops/C++ embedded developer. I also co-authored a paper in **Nature Communications** on large-scale WSI analysis and system optimization during my graduate studies.

Recently, I have been focusing on **geometry processing**, implementing projects such as
- [Marching Cubes 33(MC33)](https://github.com/hanxiaowein1/hello_cg/tree/main/hello_mc33/normal_implement),
- [Half-edge Mesh Library](https://github.com/hanxiaowein1/charles_mesh),
- [Mesh Viewer](https://github.com/hanxiaowein1/hello_opengl),

while studying Justin Solomon's [*Shape Analysis*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ3UicqQtfNtUcdTMLgKSTTOiEsCw2VBW) and mathematical foundations for geometric algorithms.

I’m currently looking for opportunities to contribute to research in geometry processing and related areas.
